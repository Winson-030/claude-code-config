Source Search & Trace

Usage: /source-search <claim_or_rumor>

This command uses a specialized information-source-tracing analyst agent to trace high-entropy claims, rumors, unverified information, or trending assertions back to their authoritative, original sources.

Purpose:
The information-source-tracing-analyst agent performs structured investigations to verify information authenticity, understand original context, and produce a comprehensive source trace report.

What it investigates:
- Unverified claims or rumors circulating online
- High-entropy assertions requiring source verification
- Trending news or information that lacks clear attribution
- Controversial statements that need authoritative sourcing

Process:
1. User provides a claim, rumor, or statement to investigate
2. Launches the information-source-tracing-analyst agent with the query
3. Agent conducts autonomous investigation to trace back to original sources
4. Returns a structured report with:
   - Original authoritative source(s)
   - Context and accuracy assessment
   - How the information evolved or was distorted
   - Credibility evaluation

Example usage:
/source-search "I heard that SEC is planning to ban all stablecoins in 2025"
/source-search "There's a rumor that Gary Gensler said crypto exchanges must register with SEC by June"
/source-search "I saw claims that the SEC issued new guidance on algorithmic stablecoins yesterday"

The agent will investigate the claim, find the original source documents or statements, analyze the context, and provide a complete trace report.
